Features:

* Exact real and complex numbers represented as elements of automatically extended multivariate fields
* Support for algebraic, transcendental and mixed fields
* Automatic, rigorous numerical embeddings and arbitrary-precision numerical evaluation (on top of Arb)
* Efficient field arithmetic (on top of Flint and Antic)
* Automatic, rigorous simplification (using integer relations, ideal reduction, and other methods)
* Complete decision procedures for algebraic numbers
* Partial decision procedures for transcendental numbers
* Polynomials and matrices with exact coefficients
* Exact real and complex algebraic numbers (absolute minpoly representation)
* Multivariate rational functions (on top of Flint)
* Gröbner basis computation (on top of Flint)
* Symbolic expressions (conversions, evaluation, LaTeX output)
